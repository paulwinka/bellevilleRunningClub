                    <p>ARLINGTON, Virginia – The Road Runners Club of America
                        (RRCA) is pleased to announce the first round of Runner
                        Friendly Community designations for 2014, which includes:
                        Belleville, IL; Richmond, VA; Rockwall, TX; Safety Harbor,
                        FL and Spokane, WA.</p>

                    <p>These communities have shown that they meet the
                        program’s criteria, which includes community
                        infrastructure, community support, and local government
                        support for running. Each community has an
                        infrastructure that can foster physical activity in a
                        safe environment. They have a proven track record that
                        organizations and businesses work together to promote
                        running as a healthy exercise and sport. With the most
                        important criteria being, there are positive
                        relationships between the running community and local
                        government.</p>

                    <p>The goal of the RRCA’s Runner Friendly Community program
                        is to shine a national spotlight on communities that
                        standout as runner-friendly and provide incentives and
                        ideas for communities to work towards becoming runner
                        friendly communities. Runner Friendly Communities can
                        also increase the quality of life, improve physical
                        activity for residents as outlined in the National
                        Physical Activity Plan, and provide for increased
                        economic impact for the community.</p>

                    <p>Congratulations to the following RUNNER FRIENDLY
                        COMMUNITIES:</p>

                    <p>Richmond, VA – Richmond demonstrates how collaboration
                        and partnerships can help to make a community runner
                        friendly. As the Capital of Virginia, the Metro Richmond
                        Area is home to over 1.2 million residents. In the
                        Richmond area, there are a variety of trails, parks, and

                        that are used year-round by runners and walkers. The
                        Virginia Capital Trail, which will eventually link
                        Williamsburg and Richmond, is in the final stages of

                        Fitness, and ACAC work closely with runners on a daily
                        basis and also sponsor some of the biggest running
                        events in Richmond. Coffee shops and restaurants, such

                        Avenue, and Hardywood Park Brewery, often serve as pre-
                        and post-run meeting spots and are safe places for
                        runners to get out of bad weather or fill a water bottle
                        during a run. Ukrop’s Homestyle Foods and Martin’s Food
                        Markets also support and sponsor events as well as offer
                        healthy eating and nutrition clinics for runners.</p>

                        Collectively these events attract thousands and
                        thousands of runners and are great community
                        celebrations of running and fitness. The events bring
                        together the support of the Sports Backers, Richmond
                        Road Runners Club, local governments, area businesses,
                        as well as clubs, teams, and individuals. They serve as
                        shining examples of the broad community support
                        available for running in Richmond.</p>

                    <p>“Richmond is an ideal candidate for the recognition as a
                        Runner Friendly Community, and I unequivocally and
                        wholeheartedly support this nomination,” commented
                        Cynthia Newbille, Richmond City Council Member. “Running
                        is an integral part of our community that has helped our

                    <p>Rockwall, TX – Home to the RRCA member Rockwall Running
                        Club, Rockwall hosts over twenty-five running and
                        triathlon events annually and is home to the US Toyota
                        Triathlon Championships and the Patriot Half Marathon.
                        While Rockwall is considered part of the larger
                        Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, it is a community of 38,000
                        residents with a dedicated running community. Emerald
                        Bay Park opened in Rockwall in January 2008 and is
                        highlighted by a lighted aerial fountain in the middle
                        of the pond, which is surround by a walking and running
                        trail.</p>

                    <p>Last year over 8,000 residents participated in running
                        events in Rockwall. The passion for running is evident
                        in the local businesses that have donated hundreds of
                        thousands of dollars to support running events in recent
                        years. The popularity of running in the community has
                        also been reflected in the tremendous growth of the
                        Rockwall Running Club, from just five members in 2009 to
                        two hundred members today. During the same time, the
                        number of road races the club hosts has grown from one
                        to twenty-five, including the only half marathon in the
                        Dallas/Fort Worth market in the month of May. Youth
                        running clubs are supported at five of the eleven
                        elementary schools in the area, and there are three
                        summer track programs for youth.</p>

                    <p>To support local races, the local government reviews
                        safety procedures for all events, provides free traffic
                        cones, and community patrols provide logistical support.
                        Rockwall print and broadcast media regularly make an
                        effort to promote and cover all events.</p>

                    <p>“To say Rockwall is a Runner Friendly Community is an
                        understatement,” commented Casey Allen, City of Rockwall
                        Parks & Recreation Manager. “From the first time you
                        visit and take a run with us, you’re a member of our
                        running family. It doesn’t matter if your 5 years old or
                        80 years old, there is someone to run with.”</p>

                    <p>Safety Harbor, FL – With year-round, favorable weather
                        along with safe, well maintained, sidewalks and streets,
                        Safety Harbor is in many ways the ideal community for a
                        runner to call home. The harbor or bay of the same name
                        on which Safety Harbor is located is the nearly
                        landlocked far northwestern extension of Tampa Bay and
                        is located on the west side of that bay. The city has a
                        population nearly 17,000 residents and is home to
                        several running clubs, including the RRCA member West
                        Florida Y Running Club.</p>

                    <p>Safety Harbor is home to the Bayshore Linear Greenway
                        Recreational Trail that was developed in 1998 to provide
                        a measured recreational path for walkers, joggers, and
                        cyclists. The trail begins at the Marina fountain and
                        includes distance markers, scenic views of Old Tampa
                        Bay, and water fountains near benches.The trail connects
                        to the Ream Wilson trail to the south and it connects to
                        Phillipe Park, a shady county park to the north. There
                        is an extensive network of sidewalks in the community as
                        well. The city has recently added three flashing
                        crosswalks to provide for safer street crossings.</p>

                    <p>The local importance of running and fitness is
                        demonstrated in Safety Harbor becoming a Let’s Move City
                        that is dedicated to solving the problem of childhood
                        obesity. Local officials and city recreation staff
                        developed goals to promote the health of residents to
                        earn the designation. The city has youth running
                        programs that operate annually including the Healthy
                        Strides, Speed & Agility, and Track program. They also
                        host running related summer camps.</p>

                    <p>The Safety Harbor business community is supportive of
                        local runners. Lola’s Running specialty store provides
                        water stops along the Bayshore trail for runners.
                        Nolan’s Pub along with the Safety Harbor Resort & Spa
                        has sponsored events. Additionally, Fit Life Foods often
                        donates healthy snacks for races.</p>

                    <p>“Not only does Safety Harbor have beautiful, safe places
                        to run, it is a community of runners,”noted Lisa Kothe,
                        Library Director for Safety Harbor Public Library. “Any
                        time of the day, even in the heat of a Florida summer,
                        runners can be spotted along Bayshore Boulevard.”</p>

                    <p>Spokane, WA – The City of Spokane is located on the
                        Spokane River in Eastern Washington and is 92 miles
                        south of the Canadian border. With a population of
                        208,916, Spokane is the second largest city in the State
                        of Washington. The Spokane area offers an abundance of
                        outdoor activities that can be enjoyed in outlying
                        natural areas that cater to runners.</p>

                    <p>In 1907, Spokane’s board of park commissioners retained
                        the services of the Olmsted Brothers to draw up a plan
                        for Spokane’s parks. Today, Spokane has a system of over
                        87 parks totaling 4,100 acres. Riverfront Park, created
                        after Expo ‘74, is 100 acres in downtown Spokane, and
                        the site of some of Spokane’s largest events including
                        the Lilac Bloomsday Run Post Race Celebration. The park
                        is a popular site for runners that includes the The Joy
                        of Running Together sculpture by David Govedare
                        installed in 1984. This steel sculpture depicts runners
                        of all kinds and celebrates the Spokane tradition of
                        Bloomsday.</p>

                    <p>A more active way to see natural sites in the Spokane
                        area includes travelling the Spokane River Centennial
                        Trail, which features over 37 miles of paved trails
                        running along the Spokane River from Sontag Park in west
                        Spokane to the east shore of Lake Coeur d’Alene in Coeur
                        d’Alene, Idaho. This trail continues on for 24 miles as
                        the North Idaho Centennial Trail in Idaho.</p>

                    <p>Each May, Spokane plays host to the Lilac Bloomsday Run,
                        one of the largest road races in the country, regularly
                        attracting 50,000 participants annually. In 2014, the
                        race will serve as the RRCA’s National 12 K
                        Championship. The RRCA member Bloomsday Road Runners
                        Club (BRRC) was founded by the Bloomsday Run and has
                        developed into a solid group of running enthusiasts
                        devoted to the promotion of a variety of running events
                        in Spokane. The BRRC will host the 56th Annual RRCA
                        National Convention May 1-4, 2014.</p>

                    <p>Local businesses are very supportive of the Spokane
                        running community. The local Starbucks allows runners to
                        use their bathrooms and they provide ice water to
                        runners as needed. The local club has been working with
                        the regional Starbucks manager to encourage their
                        corporate headquarters to work with the RRCA to
                        designate all stores as Runner Friendly Businesses.
                        Locally, Starbucks has donated coffee and tea at many
                        local running events. The local running store, Runner’s
                        Soul, allows use of their facilities to runners in need
                        while out on the run.</p>

                    <p>“The City of Spokane, and the Spokane Fire Department
                        (SFD) in particular, has been involved in community
                        healthy living initiatives for over 40 years,” comment
                        Brian Schaeffer, assistant fire chief of the City of
                        Spokane. “Spokane’s mantra is ‘Near Nature, Near
                        Perfect’ and our commitment to the healthy outdoor
                        lifestyle is reflected daily throughout our community’s
                        miles of trails, roads and formal races. I am extremely
                        proud to be a part of our community, and am humbled that
                        Spokane is being considered for the RRCA recognition.”</p>
